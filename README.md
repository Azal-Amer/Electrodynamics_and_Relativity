# A Pedagogical Study of Relativistic Electrodynamics

 This repository serves as a final project for the PHY 352L Classical Electrodynamics II class at UT Austin under Prof. Michael Downer. It is essentially an experiment --- myself and a few other students will broadly cover relativistic electrodynamics at a similar scope to Griffiths' text, pulling from more advanced or detailed sources as we see fit. The motivation behind this project is to develop a pedagogical resource for understanding and visualizing a variety of topics under the umbrella of electrodynamics and relativity as it is a subject that is not nearly as intuitive compared to other areas of physics. There is a notable lack of approachable resources on advanced physics topics that are of high quality to be useful to an undergraduate or graduate student without essentially being a dense textbook or long set of lecture notes. 

 The outline of subtopics covered in this repository are as follows:

 - [Special Relativity](https://github.com/amalbumbia/Electrodynamics_and_Relativity/tree/dfdc289b99c800f50e0a8377334629b777b9947b/special_relativity)
 - Relativistic Mechanics
 - Relativistic Electrodynamics
 - [Electrodynamics as a Gauge Theory](https://raw.githack.com/amalbumbia/Electrodynamics_and_Relativity/main/why_electrodynamics.html)
 - Applications
