# A Pedagogical Study of Relativistic Electrodynamics

 This repository serves as a final project for the PHY 352L Classical Electrodynamics II class at UT Austin under Prof. Michael Downer. It is essentially an experiment --- myself and a few other students will broadly cover relativistic electrodynamics at a similar scope to Griffiths' text, pulling from more advanced or detailed sources as we see fit. The motivation behind this project is to develop a pedagogical resource for understanding and visualizing a varaiety of topics under the umbrella of / precursory to relativistic electrodynamics as it is a subject that is not nearly as intuitive compared to other areas of physics. I personally find it quite difficult to understand and work with special relativity, particularly since it is only covered once over the scope of undergraduate physics at UT. I also generally have a difficult time visualizing concepts in electrodynamics. I suppose I am assuming that somewhere amongst other physics students, this is a shared experience, so having a broader picture along with a visual guide would certainly be a helpful tool. 

 The outline of subtopics covered in this repository are as follows:

 - Special Relativity
 - Relativistic Mechanics
 - Relativistic Electrodynamics
