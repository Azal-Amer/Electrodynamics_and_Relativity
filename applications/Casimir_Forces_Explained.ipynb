    "Perhaps chapter 12 of Griffiths seems to come out of left field, especially since throughout the text we have been working in a strictly classical regime. But recall how we celebrated over eqn 10.74, where we essentially shoved all of classical electrodynamics into one equation. We introduce relativity to encompass a wider scope of electrodynamics, because the goal is always to find the most general, all inclusive theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting too detailed, we can generalize electrodynamics to the relativistic regime and even the quantum level---this is well described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). For reference, QED is a quantum field theory that describes how the electromagnetic interaction is mediated by its gauge boson: the photon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, QED includes a description of the QED vacuum state (the lowest energy / ground state). However, this is a bit of a misnomer. Classically, we understand vacuums according to the literal definition: there are no particles, fields, or anything else. Quantum mechanically, this is untrue, and there can be ripples of quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state; essentially, particles can \"pop out\" of the vacuum for short periods of time. Incorrectly but certainly not naively, one might suggest this is due to Heisnberg's uncertainty principle regarding energy and time. This interpretation is not fully accurate (see https://books.google.com/books?id=kgsBbv3-9xwC&pg=PA224#v=onepage&q&f=false for details), so for now, less we explore the full derivation of QED, it suffices to regard these virtual particles from quantum fluctuations as mathematical artifacts of the theory."

The Klein-Gordon equation resembles the omnipresent harmonic oscillator equation. As expected, the solutions it admits are mathematically similar. Therefore, one can interpret the free field $\\psi(\\bold{x},t)$ as an infinite set of quantum harmonic oscillators. The quantum harmonic oscillator's ground state is $E_0=\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega$; notably, this is greater than 0. Like many great physicists before us, we will handwave away the fact that this implies that the vacuum contains infinite energy. Of course I'm kidding, but now we can see why this interpretation is problematic. Nonetheless, if we consider this, we can see that the vacuum would allow all modes whereas the nearly touching plates would restrict certain modes. This leads to a difference in energy---the region between the plates has less energy than the vacuum outside of this region, leading to an attractive force that pulls the plates together."
