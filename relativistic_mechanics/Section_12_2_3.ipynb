    "Now we shall explore the effects of our scared conservation laws (energy and momentum). With our definitions of relativistic energy and momentum in example 12.7, we carry through a similar procedure as in classical mechanics. We discover that mass is not conserved due to the fact that internal energy contributes to the mass of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "This has profound consequences at the particle level. Whereas in classical mechanics, the mass of an object is the sum of the masses of constituent particles $M=\\sum m_i$, the mass of a proton, for example, is NOT the sum of its valence quarks. In fact, the rest masses of the quarks (2 up, 1 down) make up only about 1% of the proton's mass. The rest of the mass comes from energy in the gluon fields (what holds the quarks together) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) effects. "

    "What we have done here is take pions and reconstrcut the invariant mass using (simulated) data from the detector. The large peak that you see right around 500 GeV is due to the kaon, which weakly decays into pi plus and pi minus. The large number of counts suggests that a significant number of kaons proceed via this decay. In the broad region shaded in red, we can see a wide distribtuion---a signficant chunk of this is due to a niche meson called the sigma meson. It's primarily responsible for quantum hadrodynamics and strong nuclear reactions (between nucleons, as opposed to just strong interactions between quarks that are mediated by gluons)."

    "However, the distribution for the kaon is much sharper than that of the sigma meson. The reason for this is due to time-energy uncertainty. The kaon lifetime is large, on the order of 10^-8 s, whereas the lifetime of the sigma meson is on the order of 10^-23 s. This miniscule lifetime leads to a much greater uncertainty in its energy, which is refelected above. Very complex methods are needed to find its mass (literally, complex analysis and analytic continuation using dispersion relations)."
