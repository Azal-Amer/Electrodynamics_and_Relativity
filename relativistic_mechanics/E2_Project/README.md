Hello there, this is Daniel's contribution to the project. This includes Relativistic_Doppler_Effect.html, Section_12_2_1.html, Section_12_2_4.html, Section_12_2_1.ipynb, Section_12_2_2.ipynb, Section_12_2_3.ipynb, Section_12_2_4.ipynb, and Casimir_Forces_Explained.ipynb.

I'm so glad I got to learn about Casimir forces, and I really enjoyed this project that not only was conducive to my now deeper understanding of relativistic electrodynamics but went beyond the book as well.
