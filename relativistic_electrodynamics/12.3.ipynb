In this way, we see how electricity and magnetism can not exist without the other!\n",

    "\n",
    "Our entire field formulation of classical electrodynamics hinges on the statement that the field at a particular point should be able to give us all the information needed to calculate forces on the particle; that is, we dont need to know anything about the field sources. This means that if we want to find out how fields transform, we have our pick of field sources and our derived transformation rule will apply to fields caused by any other source. So, let us turn to our old friend the capacitor!\n",

    "\n",
    "In its own rest frame, the capacitor has a constant electric field in between the plates oriented perpendicular to the plates. Let's see what happens in a reference frame $S$ moving at velocity $v_0$ laterally relative to the capacitor:\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, since the charged plates are moving, we now have surface current $\\textbf{K}$, which produces a magnetic field!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can compare the fields $E_y$ and $B_z$ of reference frame $S$ to the fields $\\overline{E}_y$ and $\\overline{B}_z$ in reference frame $\\overline{S}$ which is moving at $v$ velocity relative to $S$ and at $\\overline{v}$ relative to the rest frame of the capacitor:\n",

Also, the symmetry of the plates means that there is no magnetic field in any inertial reference frame, so we will need another field source to study how $B_x$ transforms. We will now turn to our friend the solenoid!\n",

    "\n",
    "- **4-vectors**: examples include displacement $(ct, x, y, z)$, proper velocity, proper momentum, current density (will be formulated below)\n",
    "- **Minkowski metric**: matrix ($\\eta$) that defines the inner product:\n",
    "  Given two 4-vectors $X^\\mu$ and $Y^\\mu$, their inner product in Minkowski space is $X^\\mu\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}Y^\\nu$\n",
    "- **4-covectors**: Instead of having to write $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ over and over again, we will simply embed it into our vectors. Let the covector $X_\\mu$ be defined by:\n",

    "  Now, there is deeper mathematical meaning to this, these covectors actually live in a dual space to Minkowski space. But the main cool convenience to us physicists is that now as long as all of our indices are paired (one superscripted, one subscripted), we know it is invariant between reference frames (since the Minkowski metric is invariant). Later, we are going to rewrite Maxwell's equations in tensor form, and the paired indices will prove to us that the equations are invariant!\n",

    "  Thus, the inner product stays the same even after transforming $X$ and $Y$. Again, this means that any expression involving our vector/covectors and $\\Lambda$ is invariant as long as all indices are in pairs. There are two main types of Lorentz transformations:\n",

Instead of cancelling out indice pairs to represent decreasing in dimension like an inner product does, the dyad product between two vectors/covectors keeps all their indices, so it increases in dimension from its multiplied parts.
